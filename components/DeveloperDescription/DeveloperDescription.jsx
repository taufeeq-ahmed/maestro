                In 2014, I decided to delve deep into custom themes on Nova Launcher in Android to make my launcher system completely customizable. This led me into the abyss of digital design. From there, I proceeded to learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and as you can see... here I am, a professional Full Stack Engineer.

                My main focus these days is building products at Cogoport. I enjoy creating software where design and engineering converge â€” things that look good but are also well-built under the hood. In my free time, I&apos;ve also explored various development environments such as Jetpack Compose, ElectronJS, and many more.
