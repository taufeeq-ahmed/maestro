                Back in 2014, I decided go deep into cutome themes on Nova launcher in android to make my launcher system completely customizable and fell into
                the abyss of digital design. From there I went on to learn basic HTML, CSS
                and Javascript and as you can see .... here I am a professional Full Stack Engineer.

                My main focus these days is building products at Cogoport. I enjoy building software where design and engineering meet. Things that look good but are also built well under the hood. In my free time, I&apos;ve also explored various developement environments such as Jetpack Compose, SwiftUi, ElectronJS and many more.
